# liquidfire:Dates
Getting started with dates. First step is to add a date field to a schema somewhere:

```json 
{
    "properties": {
        "firstName": {
            
        }
    }

}


```

## Making a timepicker
Give any `<input/>` the class of `bootstrap-timepicker`.
```html

<input type="text" class="bootstrap-timepicker" />

```
